An easy-to-use, mobile-centric tabata workout timer web app. Made with React and the MaterialUI library.

## Usage

A default tabata workout consists of a set of eight 20-second intensive workout intervals.
Ten seconds of rest between each interval.

The side menu allows total HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) customisation of workout sets, intervals and timings (999 max).

A favorite workout can be saved by tapping the "cloud upload" button in the side menu. Similarly, the 
saved workout can be re-loaded by tapping the "cloud download" button. The favorite workout will load
